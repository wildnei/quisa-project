## User story

I am an avid gamer that has 100% completed everything in my game library. I am completely lost as to what I would like to play next and need help. I want to be able to search a title my friend told me about and get a quick breakdown of the game and overall thoughts and price of the game. If the game I search doesn’t sound like something I want to play, I want to click a button and have the website recommend a game.

## What makes our APP unique

Our search is not platform specific. Games will show on our search regardless of if it is an exclusive on Steam, Playstation, or Xbox.
We use an api designed to display the best available price at all times, not just standard retail price.

NO ADS! Our app is lightweight and doesn’t annoy you with ads while you’re trying to figure out what next game you’d like to play.

No algorithms! The search on our app goes through no filters or curation system. What you search for is what you get! No frills or wizardry in displaying you the information you searched for.
